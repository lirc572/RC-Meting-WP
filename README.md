# Additional Information

> if the `no_referer` option is set to `true`, a meta tag will be added to the head section of the webpage to prevent sending the Referer header.
> It is noticed that if referer header is sent, sometimes Netease api will return 403.
> However, enabling this option will affect all requests made on the web page. Hence you should only enable this option if you know what you are doing.

> `autoplay` does not work due to <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/APlayer/issues/281" target="_blank">an issue with Aplayer</a>

> `fixed` mode is currently not displayed correctly
